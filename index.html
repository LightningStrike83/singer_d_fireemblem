            <h3 class="lb_heading">Marth: Hero King</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                When the nation of Dohlr attacked, Prince Marth of Altea was forced to flee and take refuge on the island nation of Talys, leaving behind his sister Elice, who provided him time to escape. Training and growing, Marth eventually left the island with his friend Princess Caeda, to lead the charge against Dohlr. Not only to take back his homeland, but to free other lands from their reign as well.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                His exploits became widely known, gaining the attention of many, such as Princess Nyna of Archanea, who entrusted him with the sacred item known as the Binding Shield. This item was a key item that would defeat the leader of the Dohlr nation, the Earth Dragon known as Medeus.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Thanks to aid from his friends and allies, Marth was able to free the continent of Archenea from Dohlr's wrath not once, but twice, as a second war broke out as a ploy to revive the Earth Dragon after his defeat by Marth's hands during the first war. Thanks to all he, and his army, accomplished, he earned the title known as "Hero King" and was written about in history books for years to come, becoming a source of inspiration to many.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Growing up as a noblewoman, Clair's world came crashing down when General Desaix and the Rigelain army began invading Zofia. Her family was stripped of their power and forced to flee, lest their lives be lost. Her brother, Clive, began leading a resistance against the invading army, to which Clair lent her aid.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Eventually, Clive stepped down as leader and offered the position to the grandson of the renowned knight Sir Mycen, Alm. Having been rescued by Alm prior, and him becoming the object of her affection, Clair had no objections. She offered her lance and pegasus in his aid and followed him in his quest to drive back the Rigelian army and bring peace back to the lands of Zofia once more.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Eirika: Pledged Restorer</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                A pacifist at heart, Princess Eirika of Renais grew up alongside her brother Prince Ephraim, and her best friend Prince Lyon of Grado. 
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                When Grado invaded Renais and killed Eirika and Ephraim's father, she had no choice but to take up arms to defend her country and find out the truth. She rallied many allies from across the continent, until she confronted her childhood friend, who appeared to be possessed by the demon known as Fomortiis.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                To her, it appeared as if the possession had not fully consumed Lyon as of yet, so she willingly gave up her country's most precious treasure, the Sacred Stone of Renais, thinking it would purge the demon from his body. However, this was a ruse by Fomortiis to acquire the stone, which was one of five stones needed to ressurrect its own demonic body. Now, Eirika must right her wrong and fight against her feelings and memories and slay the demon once and for all, lest all of Magvel suffer from her ignorance.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">L'Arachel: Harvest Princess</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Many tell the tale of the "Beautiful Princess of Peerless Beauty", a hero who travels across Magvel to help those in need and slay monsters that plague the land. Yet, the tale of a hero always begins tragically.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Her parents, the king and queen of the country of Rausten, believed in order and justice. They were an inspiration to the young princess, but their tale ended abruptly as they were slain in the Darkling Woods by monsters.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Emulating her parents' behaviour, L'Arachel travels the land with her retainer, Dozla, and her "Reluctant-Guard-For-Hire" Rennac, wanting to carry on their work. This eventually leads Eirika to cross paths with Princess Eirika and Prince Ephraim of Renais, where she offered her group's services in their war against Grado and the Demon King Fomortiis.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Ike: Vanguard Legend</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Son of the renowned hero and leader of the Greil Mercenaries, Ike had big shoes to fill upon the premature death of his father. Not many believed in him at first, with some even leaving the mercenary group, unwilling to take orders from anyone other than their former leader.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                However, as Ike travelled across the land and finished his father's last job, protecting the Princess of Crimea, Elincia Crimea Ridell, Ike proved himself to be a valiant hero and a worthy successor to his father's mercenaries.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Participating in two nation-wide wars, Ike eventually comes face to face with the instigator of the wars; the Prime Minister of Begnion; whose goal was to prematurely awaken the Goddess of Chaos through war. In doing so, it would also awaken the Goddess of Order who would cast divine judgement on humanity for their sins. Taking up arms alongside the Goddess of Chaos who believes in humanity, Ike led the charge against the Goddess of Order and her subordinates so that humanity would have the chance to thrive once more.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Soleil: Adorable Adorer</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Growing up in an alternate dimension, known as the Deeprealms, where time flows quicker than other realms, Soleil spent much of her life without her parents around. However, she always kept on smiling, trying to be an inspiration to all. She eventually left the Deeprealms and started her own band of mercenaries. Along the way, she met up with her father and the army led by Corrin, and offered her assistance to their cause.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Taking much after her father, Laslow, Soleil is a notorious flirt, whose main motivation to fight is to protect all of the cute girls of the world. Much unlike her father, however, she appears to be naturally talented in courting ladies and taking them to tea, something that baffles Laslow.
